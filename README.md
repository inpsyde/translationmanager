# TranslationMANAGER for WordPress
With TranslationMANAGER, it is easy and straightforward to export content from your WordPress Multisite to be translated by Inpsyde's trusted partner [Eurotext](https://eurotext.de/en/).

## Description

TranslationMANAGER is a WordPress plugin that allows a user with the correct roles to request a translation of one or multiple articles, pages etc.  However, TranslationMANAGER cannot import the content into the correct location because it does not have any information in relation to this. A Multilingual plugin is required for this purpose. 

TranslationMANAGER works on sites with [MultilingualPress 3](https://multilingualpress.org/), Inpsydeâ€™s solution for multilingual WordPress sites.

MultilingualPress requires some setup and our [documentation](https://multilingualpress.org/docs-category/multilingualpress-3-getting-started/) provides information on how to connect sites and content.

Knowledge of how to connect content is not required, because the MLP module which is included in Translation Manager will carry out this task.

Basically, when you request a translation and import it afterwards, the MLP module will perform the task in the background.

## Setting up TranslationMANAGER

For TranslationMANAGER to work correctly, the API key has to be set.

Every site has its own settings and it is possible to have different API keys for each site or to use one API key for all sites.
To add the API key, go to TranslationMANAGER > Settings > Connection from within a site.

Enter the information in the Api Key field and click on Save changes.

Now you are ready to create projects and translate content.

## Creating and Managing Projects

There are two ways to create a new project.

Go to TranslationMANAGER > Translations > Projects and complete the fields under the section Create new project. The description is optional and can be omitted.

You can Delete or View the project by hovering over the project name in the table on the right.

The second way to create a project is to request a translation, which is described in the Inquiry for Translation chapter.
Managing the Project

To manage the project, click on the View link to see the available actions below the project name.

The Project page makes it possible to change the project settings, order a translation, view the status of the translation and import the translation.

As much content as required can be collected before placing the order for translation.
Afterward, the status button can be used to get updates on the translations and to import the translated content.

## Project Statuses

A project can have different statuses.

| Status | What does it mean? |
| --- | --- |
| ***Pending*** | We have received your request for quotation. |
| ***Feedback*** | You have received the price, timeline and scope of the project. The quote is ready for approval by you. |
| ***Rejected*** | You have rejected the quote. |
| ***In progress*** | We are working on your project. |
| ***Finished*** | Your project has been completed and is ready for download. |
| ***Imported*** | The translations have been successfully imported into your system. |

The initial status, when you have collected the content you want to translate and before you place the order, is: Ready to order.

When you click on Place Order, the status of the project will change to In Transition, which means
that the content you want to translate has been sent to the server.

To get updates on the current status of the translation, simply click on the Update button.
One thing to note is the Project Number. This is the number of the project on the server
which can be used when contacting support in case of problems.

## Importing Project Content

When all the content within a project has been translated, the status of the project will change to Finished and the content can be imported.

Remember, the status can only be updated through an explicit update request by clicking on the Update button.

At this point, all that is required is a click on Import and TranslationMANAGER will do the rest.

After the content has been imported, it is always possible to re-import the content. This is useful because it makes it possible to remove a translation for any reason whatsoever and import a new one.

But this feature has a downside, as it creates new content without checking if translated content

 is already present.

This is not a problem because it does not affect the existing content. However, importing the translations multiple times will create duplicate content.

## Installation

### Requirements

-   WordPress 5.0 or higher.
-   PHP 7.2 or higher.

### Installation

To install the TranslationMANAGER plugin after installing MLP, go to Network Admin > Plugins > Add New and search for TranslationMANAGER.

As this is a network installation, the plugin can be activated for the entire network.
This will automatically make the plugin available to all sites within the network.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Do I need an API key?**

Yes, you need your own API key to connect with the Eurotext servers. For more information, see https://eurotext.de/en/documentation/wordpress/

**Where do I get my own API key?**

Just send an email to info@eurotext.de with a request.

**Issue with References in Reusable Blocks.**

In instances where Gutenberg's reusable blocks are utilized, there may be discrepancies in the references within imported posts. This can result in missing or inaccurate references to the corresponding reusable blocks.

Specifically, the issue arises when the imported posts receive different IDs compared to the original posts, causing the references to become mismatched.

*Illustrative Example:*

For instance, let's consider a reusable block named "Text-Section" with the ID 1429. This block is utilized on the main page, and in the database, it is referenced as Ref: 1429, allowing it to be displayed.

On the Spanish version of the site, the same "Text-Section" block is assigned the ID 189. However, in the database, the main page continues to search for the reusable block with the reference 1429, which no longer exists. Consequently, WordPress encounters difficulty in displaying the block.

*Identifying Reusable Blocks:*

To identify reusable blocks in the database, look for the following markup: *<!-- wp:block {"ref":1429} /-->*
